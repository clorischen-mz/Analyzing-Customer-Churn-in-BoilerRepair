# Analyzing Customer Churn in TeleBoiler using Power BI
Reducing customer churn is a top priority at TeleBoiler (a fictitious satellite TV provider), as it's easier to retain current customers than to draw new customers. This project sought to provide insights into why customers are churning from TeleBoiler at the rate they are, the key characteristics of churners, and potential actions to be taken to retain customers.

## Overview
Some insights from the exploratory analysis:
1. The churn rate for TeleBoiler is 27.3%.
2. The top reason why customers churn is because competitors made better offers than TeleBoiler did.
3. ~45% of the customers churn from TeleBoiler due to competitor-related reasons.
4. California has an extremely high churn rate (63.6%), and no other states have a churn rate greater than 36%. California also has the highest churn rate (80.7%) for customers who have month-to-month contracts. TeleBoiler should further investigate the reason why so many customers in California decide to churn.
