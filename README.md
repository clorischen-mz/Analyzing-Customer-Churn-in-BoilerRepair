# Analyzing Customer Churn in TeleBoiler using Power BI
Reducing customer churn is a top priority at TeleBoiler (a fictitious satellite TV provider), as it's easier to retain current customers than to draw new customers. This project sought to provide insights into why customers are churning from TeleBoiler at the rate they are, the key characteristics of churners, and potential actions to be taken to retain customers.

## Overview
Some insights from the exploratory analysis:
1. The churn rate for TeleBoiler is 27.3%.
2. The top reason why customers churn is because competitors made better offers than TeleBoiler did.
3. ~45% of the customers churn from TeleBoiler due to competitor-related reasons.
4. California has an extremely high churn rate (63.6%), and no other states have a churn rate greater than 36%. California also has the highest churn rate (80.7%) for customers with month-to-month contracts. TeleBoiler should further investigate the reason why so many customers in California decide to churn.

Recommendation: TeleBoiler needs to make more competitive offers than its competitors to stop losing customers. This can be proposing a cheaper plan to at-risk customer groups before they churn, further investigating how offers from competitors are better than TeleBoiler, and presenting retention offers to customers who switched to other providers.

## Churners by Age Groups
Some insights from looking into churners by age groups
1. About 40% of older adults (65 or above) churned from TeleBoiler, which is ~14% higher than the churn rate for other age groups.
2. The top reason why older adults churn is because competitors made better offer.
3. Customers who are not in a group plan, in the age group 50, and with an account length of 12 months or less have a churn rate of 48.3%.
Recommendation: TeleBoiler should seek to improve the quality of its devices because itâ€™s the #2 reason why customers churn and #1 reason why customers on unlimited plans churn.
